        We are an open-source AI research and development company committed to
        advancing the training, fine-tuning, and inference of pre-trained large
        language models, while openly sharing the datasets used in the process.
        Our vision is to become the &quot;Linux of AI,&quot; where
        everything—from the codebase to the data pipeline—is open and accessible
        to all.
